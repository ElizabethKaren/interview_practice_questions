#You're given an array of positive integers representing the prices of a single stock on various days 
# (each index in the array represents a different day). You're also given an integer K, which represents 
# the number of transactions you're allowed to make. One transaction consists of buying the stock on a 
# given day and selling it on another, later day. You're asked to write a function that returns the 
# maximum profit that you can make by buying and selling the stock given K transactions.Â 
#Note you can only hold one share of the stock at a time; in other words, you cant buy more than one 
# share of the stock on any given day, and you cant buy more than one share of the stock on any given 
# day, and you cant buy a share of the stock if you're still holding another share. Also, you don't 
# need to use all K transactions that you're allowed.
